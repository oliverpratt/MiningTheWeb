      <h3> Visualization Critique 2 - Jonah Bleckner</h3>
      <h3>Accidental Skyline</h3>
      <p>For my second visualization critique, I chose a CartoDB map that was produced by the Municipal Arts Society, entitled <a href= "http://www.mas.org/urbanplanning/accidental-skyline/"> "Accidental Skyline,"</a> in response to the proliferation of huge skyscrapers along the southern border of Central Park. This map has the potential to serve as a tool for the public to engage in the on-going and contentious debate about real estate development in the city.</p>
      <p>This map successfully allows users to make six different layers visible simultaneously. The first two layers illutrate the available Floor to Area Ratio (FAR) accross the five boroughs. Regions of the city with a high level of FAR availability (i.e. underused development rights) are considered extremely ripe for developers to build huge profitable building as-of-right. The map then allows users to see the spatial relationship between  the neighborhoods in NYC that are vulnerable to large scale developments, with the historic districts that are protected by the the Landmarks Preservation Committee. Other layers on this interactive map include: Parks, NYCHA's real estate portfolio, and the Subway Lines. One UX issue with this map is that you cannot easily compare the state of each borough; one is forced to look at each borough in isolation. However, the data visualization clearly communicates which areas of the city are likely to see massive redevelopments that are destructive to local communities.</p>

      <h3> Visualization Critique 2 - Matthew Caruso</h3>
      <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2016/04/14/every-kobe-bryant-shot-charted/"> Every Shot Ever Taken By Kobe Bryant </a>
      <p> One very interesting visualization that caught my eye was the visualization for the data presented on how every shot Kobe Bryant took throughout his 20 year career in the NBA. Throughout Kobe Bryant's 20 season career as a Los Angeles Laker it was recorded that he has taken 30,699 shots, which is an absurb amount of shots. I found this visualization on FlowingData.com and had many concerns on how they presented this data. For instense, I thought it was very confusing to understand because of how much data there is and how clustered the map was. After looking into this data set in more detail, I did find it very interesting that something like this could ever been recorded properly. </p>
      <p> One of the aspects of the map that I found very interesting and very useful was how exact each shot was recorded. On this map you are able to click on different spots that they have marked down and it goes crazy details like what day the shot was taken and even time that shot was taken against. You are also able to see on the map where Kobe Bryant made a majority of his shots throughout his career and it even breaks it down into percentage on how often Kobe Bryant would have made that particular shot. There are also other very interesting sets of data recorded on this made such as the very first field goal Kobe Bryant made and what day he made this shot on. Each shot is color coated to express wether he made it or not and how important certain shots were depending on the game. I could imagine that this visualization might be something the Laker's organization can use to express how valuable Kobe Bryant was to there organization and might be fun to look into for a die hard Kobe fan.</p>

      <p> This visualization shows the amount of Victorian Box Trees there are planted along the streets in San Fransico and what street they are more commonly planted on. The Victorian Box Tree is known to be a very common and a type of tree that does very well in the San Francisco environment. I decided to go with a heat map to display this visualization because it shows where the density of Victorian Box Trees are in San Francisco. </p>
      <p> As you can see on this visualization, the majority of Victorian Box Trees are planted within the Northeast section of San Francisco. They are manly located in along the Mission District neighborhood and the Western Addition neighborhood. The Victorian Box Tree is also very dense along main streets in San Francisco such as Golden Gate Avenue. After analyzing the data it was very interesting to see where these types of trees where planted and could be very useful to find the reasonings behind why these trees are planted on these streets, either because they are survive better in those parts of the city or if they are simply visually appealing </p>

      <h3> Kansas City 2014 Homicide Data </h3>
      <p><iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://snoor101.cartodb.com/viz/0008749e-05b6-11e6-9c5e-0e8c56e2ffdb/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></p>
      <p> Using Kansas City's (KC) Open Data portal, The <a href="https://snoor101.cartodb.com/viz/4e289c2a-01a2-11e6-8231-0ef7f98ade21/public_map" target="_blank">original map</a> I created a torque map using the dataset for Crime in KC in the year of 2014. In order to use the data set, I had to remove unnecessary columns (ie. reference numbers, codes) to allow CartoDB to succesfully geocode the dataset. I also added columns, 'State', and 'Country' to easily allow CartoDB recognize the addresses for the reported crimes. I was the able to visualize the data with the 'Torque' wizard, and was able to have the map play out the different reported crimes throughout the year.</p>
      <p> As the data set was quite large with many points, I decided to clean the dataset further to display crimes labeled <q>Homicide-Non Negligent</q> and created an animated cumulative heat map. Due to the fact there were no longitude or latitude points within the dataset file, the file was geocoded via <q>BatchGeo</q> and analyzed as a KML file. From the heatmap, all of the 2014 homicide incidence were better visualized and allows us to see the concentration of crime and in which region.</p>

      <a href="https://zaccuardi.cartodb.com/viz/617dcecc-0048-11e6-82e3-0ef7f98ade21/public_map">Seattle bike and ride infrastructure</a>
      <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://zaccuardi.cartodb.com/viz/617dcecc-0048-11e6-82e3-0ef7f98ade21/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p>I managed to add four layers to my CartoDB map, including a heat map of Seattle's bike rack facilities overlayed on the Puget Sound bike lane network. I added park-and-ride facilities and regional 'transit centers' for good measure, to hint at places where cars are afforded an easy access point to transit networks but bikes might not be. I coded these point facilities in an intuitive way and tried to color them so that they are visually distinct. There are a few places where this doesn't happen nicely and the icons overlap. I couldn't see an easy way to ask CartoDB to avoid these overlaps but I did make one of the icons more transparent, which helps.</p>

      <p>There are a couple takeaways here. First, on a basic level, bike racks don't map very strongly to bike infrastructure. It's important to have a place to lock your bike, but somewhat moot for most riders if you don't have a safe and convenient means of getting there. Second, with respect to what transit professionals refer to as "first-last mile" access to public transportation, cars in Seattle are substantially advantaged compared to bicycles. In other words, it is much more convenient to drive to a public transportation hub (either a park and ride facility or a Transit Center) than it is to ride a bicycle there in the Seattle region.</p>

      <p>It's too bad that the bike rack data is only for the City of Seattle, but I suppose open data beggars can't be open data choosers. The differences in extent is one issue; a lack of current-ness is another. The bike route map looks like it hasn't been updated since 2011, for example -- which I wouldn't fault them for if it was something harder to inventory, like bike racks, but one would hope that each city in the region would have pretty up-to-date knowledge of the extents of their bike networks (and that this would be of interest to the county/region). Lastly, it would have been nice to do a torque-style cumulative map of bike rack installations, but the data wasn't of sufficient quality to make this possible. The dataset does have timestamps by bike rack but the timestamps aren't accurate enough, making most of the racks clump together when you use torque to visualize the data.</p>

      <h3>Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities vis-a-vis Foreign-Born Senior Populations</h3>
      <iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://jobleckner.cartodb.com/viz/3930d84c-0593-11e6-9de9-0ef7f98ade21/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p> According to a report published by the Center for an Urban Future (CUF), "Neighborhoods or housing developments with large concentrations of older people may be eligible to be named Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORC)." The NORC programs then offer in-place supportive services to the geographically-defined areas or housing developments that have a critical threshold of residents that are 60 years of age or older and have moderate to low incomes.</p>
      <p> For this project, I wanted to show that the distribution of NORCs in NYC are not aligned with the neighborhoods in which there is a high growth in immigrant seniors. In other words, the supportive services that are attached to the NORCs are not reaching immigrant senior communities as effectively as native-born senior communities. I would like to update this project by utilizing neighborhood shape files instead of the borough shape files in order to communicate this story in a finer grain.</p>

        <p>This visualization shows public artwork overlayed with zoning areas in Charlotte, NC. I used the "simple" wizard for the artwork layer and was able to import Json vectors directly from Data.gov for the zoning categories. I added a hover to see more details/ get some more context about the type of art in each location. </p>
        <p>This was where the data itself became a little problematic because of inconsistent labelling and missing datafields.</p>
        <p>It was interesting to see a cluster of artwork in the center of the city which was categorized as "other" in terms of zoning- it might be useful to overlay foot traffic// bike paths to see how much exposure the pieces actually get.</p>

      <a href="http://media.bizj.us/view/img/4471501/sarah-marijuana-scenario-c1*750xx1199-679-0-98.jpg" target="blank"> Recreational Marijuana Zoning in Seattle</a>
      <p> The reason I chose this map was because of how huge of a factor the zoning was throughout the entire process of legalization. It was the key debate for opponents and supporters alike of this new industry that ws bound to thrive; where can and can't recreational shops be allowed to open?</p>
      <p>
      What I appreciate about this map is the careful detail to zoning, precisely showing the areas where new store are allowed to open. In addition, the points on the map which indicate both current medicinal dispensaries and others which plan on expanding into the recreational industry. However, it is the lack of other factors, other points and polugons, which represent schools, day cares, and other points or areas of interest where legal shops are forbidden from opening, which take away from this map's greatest potential. Thus, it is more two-dimensional and does not tell the complte story. If anything, I am left more confused by the zoning. </p>

      <h3> Visualization Critique 1 - Zak Accuardi </h3>
      <a href="http://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/CyclePhilly/"> Cycle Philly </a> 
      <p> Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) is using a fun dataset gathered from the "Cycle Philly" app, which tracks users' cycling routes and prompts them to enter their trip purposes. This kind of data is valuable in transportation planning because it is hard to keep track of how many people actually use bike infrastructure, let alone why. Nonetheless this dataset is relatively incomplete just by virtue of the fact that it only represents the behaviors of 220 Philadelphia bike riders. To the mapmakers' credit, they acknowledge this clearly. </p>
      <p> The map's aesthetic is nice. The black background with bright colored lines seems like an industry standard at this point. It's a nice touch to distinguish between trip density along each corridor using both line width and color -- this map is trying to communicate one thing at a time and do it really clearly.  </p>
      <p> The interactive functionality is modest but informative, mostly allowing users to visualize frequent bike routes by specific trip purpose (by default, all trips are aggregated). It would be nice to be able to overlay different trip types to compare them more directly, or to add some additional contextual information, e.g. census demographics or even some of the major destinations that riders might be riding to and from. </p>

    <h3>Visualization Critique 1 - Jonathan Marable</h3>

      <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/the-park-service-maps-americas-natural-and-human-made-soundscapes-and-silences/"> The Park Service Maps America's Natural and Human-Made Soundscapes and Silences </a>

      <p> This article released on April 11, 2016 by the New York Times refers to a set of maps created by the National Park Service that showed amounts of ambient noise throughout the United States. The data was visualized quite well. The choropleth allowed for distinction between ranges of noise. The addition of the note distinguishing between the maps was definitely important to know in order to understand what the major takeaway should be from the maps. Though the map is missing titles, the legend helps the viewer understand what the map is showing.</p>

      <p> As stated on the National Park Service's site <a href=
      "http://www.nature.nps.gov/sound/soundmap.cfm"> Mapping Sound on a National Scale </a>, such maps are important because, 
      "http://www.nature.nps.gov/sound/soundmap.cfm"> Mapping Sound on a National Scale</a>, such maps are important because, 
      <blockquote>
      Park visitors and wildlife interact with each other and park resources through their senses, including the sense of hearing. So, protection of natural sounds is good for both ecosystems and the quality of visitor experience. Additionally, there are laws and policies that require the agency to conserve acoustic environments “unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."
      </blockquote>
      Mapping sound was a great way to bring awareness to the presence of sound in the environment. The story told by these maps are easy enough to understand whether the reader is a park official, a policymaker, or merely a resident of the United States.
      </p>
      <p> The visualization reveals compelling takeaways regarding ambient noise, land use, and the natural environment. I found the amount of naturally-occurring ambient noise to be particularly surprising. Though it informs us that noise levels tend to be higher in areas with greater moisture and vegetation, it also shows the mere presence of people tends to result in greater ambient noise. The level of ambient noise only increases as the concentration of people increases, and ambient noise levels are particularly high in cities. I would be curious to see a pair of maps comparing ambient noise levels during the day to ambient noise levels at night.</p>
      <p> The source data set can be found at the <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2217356"> NPS Data Store</a>. This location is also home to other data sets and maps pertaining to observations such as Nighttime Lights and Wind Power Potential. This source could be an important one to explore in terms of understanding and facing challenges we may face in the future regarding land management.</p>

      <h3>Visualization Critique 1 - Jonah Bleckner</h3>
      <h3>The Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters</h3>
      <p>For this assignment, I wanted to select and reflect upon a data visualization that has reached a large audience, and so for that reason I chose a recent interactive map that was published by the New York Times entitled, <a href= "http://nyti.ms/23nEYyr"> "Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters." </a> (On the subreddit, "DataisBeautiful," this trending NYT map has been viewed 4,784 times.)</p>
      <p>This visualization maps the life expectancy of 40-year olds with household incomes below $28,000, adjusted for race. In other words, the author of this map wanted to illustrate that beyond income, geography has a significant effect on public health. I think that this simple visualization powerfully drives this point home, especially since it is evident that life expectancy is on average higher for those individuals that live in some of the wealthier American cities along the east and west coast. From a technical standpoint, I did have some trouble figuring out what polygonal parameters were used by the author. They are vaguely identified as areas, and are too big to be census tracts or counties.</p> 
      <p>I also thought about how my perception about what message the map communicates transformed after reading the accompanying text. It contextualized the map within the current debates and scholarship that exists about the intersection between wealth and public health. In some ways, this map tells a nuanced story that challenges us to pose complex public policy questions.</p>

      <p>One visualization that I found online was a map generated by Google to show the amount of people that were flying around the United States on Thanksgiving. The data is represented in a torque map and shows different airlanes color coded flying across the United States. I thought this was very interesting and effective why to display this data set because it shows were these flights are taking off and were they are landing.</p>
      <p> A map like this can show you how diverse the United States is and how someone can have family members living across the country. This map also shows flights leaving the United States and going overseas into different countries as well and this information is very useful because it shows you what types of airlines actually travel overseas. I was very impressed with how this data was represented in this map and I thought this map made it very easy to understand where certain airline companies fly and it was also very interesting to see where their final destination will be.</p>

      <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/11/upshot/for-the-poor-geography-is-life-and-death.html" target="_blank"> The Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters</a> 
      <p> This Monday, the NY Times published <q>The Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters</q> and had a powerful visualization mapping out the life expectancy in relation with income. The data was supplied from the JAMA article <q>The Association Between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001-2014</q> which was published a day before According to the study design from the JAMA: Income data for the US population were obtained from 1.4 billion deidentified tax records between 1999 and 2014, mortality data were obtained from Social Security Administration death records.</p> 
      <p> Due to the fact that the visualization itself was interactive, you were able to see the data clearly as it mapped out life expectancies. However, it should be noted that the visualization clearly states <q>Life expectancy of 40-year-olds with household incomes below $28,000, adjusted for race</q>. Though it was seamless to look at the different life expectancies in various parts of the US on the map, it only reflected on a certain household income which could not be altered. Though, the data is then reorganized in a tabular format with more income levels (plus various correlations) and their corresponding life expectancies.</p>
